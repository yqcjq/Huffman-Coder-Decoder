东风夜放花千树，
更吹落，星如雨。
宝马雕车香满路。
凤箫声动，
玉壶光转，
一夜鱼龙舞。
蛾儿雪柳黄金缕，
笑语盈盈暗香去。
众里寻他千百度，
蓦然回首，
那人却在，
灯火阑珊处。
Lanterns look like thousands of flowers aglow;
Later like stars, from the skies, fallen below.
On main streets, horses and carriages ply.
There, ladies shed perfume, as they pass by.
Orchestral music and song greet our ears,
As the moon, slow and steady, eastward veers.
Of the Spring Festival, this night marks the end.
The whole night, capering, carps and dragons spend.
Adorned with ribbons or paper flowers on their head,
Clad in their best raiment, something bright or red,
Women squeeze their way among the festive crowd,
As they talk and laugh; even giggle around.
Roughed and powdered; perfumed to their hearts’ content,
They cannot but leave behind a subtle scent.
Up and down the main streets, I must have run –
A thousand times or more in quest of none,
Who, I have concluded, cannot be found;
For, everywhere, no trace of her can be seen,
When, all of a sudden, I turn around,
That’s her, where lanterns are few and far between.
